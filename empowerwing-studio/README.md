## Inspiration
We are inspired by women, non-binary, and gender non-conforming individuals who are creative, passionate, self-starters. Those who take the leap to put themselves, their art, and their small businesses out on the Internet. We hope to empower and amplify their voices by providing a platform for showcasing their talents and creation. Through our website, we aim to cultivate a supportive community that celebrates diversity and fosters inclusivity in the creative industry.
## What it does
Our website features artists, small business owners, and creators, especially those that identify as women, non-binary, and gender non-conforming. Artists can apply on our website by submitting their name, biography, links, profile picture, and pictures of their work. Viewers can scroll throw the Artist Showcase to see the information and work of all featured artists.
## How we built it
**Tech Stack:** React with TypeScript, PostgreSQL and Supabase
## Challenges we ran into
Our greatest hurdle to overcome was handling **image storing** in the database, PostgreSQL. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As a team of first time Hackers, we are most proud to have built a website from scratch! We are proud of ourselves for learning new tech while also completing and deploying a project in just 36 hours!
## What we learned
Through this project, we've honed our **CSS** skills and learned to craft thematic, visually-appealing web designs. We have embraced **React** with **TypeScript** and gained an appreciation for this duo's flexibility, usability, and accessibility. Additionally, we learned to work with a new database, **PostgreSQL**, and integrated it into our tech stack. Ultimately, this project has helped us to advance both our frontend and backend development skills.
## What's next for EmpowerWing Studio
- **Verification:** We hope to implement the ability to verify submissions for artist features; we currently are able to check for valid and complete submissions but need to implement more safeguards for what artist's and content will be featured on the website.
- **Searching:** We would like to add hashtags to the artist showcase which will be chosen by the artist (i.e. graphic design, crochet, etc.) Ideally, users can search by tags to find artists in a specific field.
- **Communication:** We envision our website to facilitate more communication among the community in the future. We hope to integrate commenting and other interactive features on artist showcases.
